								<p>"...I was rich, if not in money, in sunny hours and summer days."-Henry David Thoreau.</p>
								<p>When Thoreau wrote that line, he was thinking of the Walden Pond he knew as a boy.
								Woodchoppers and the iron horse had not yet greatly damaged the beauty of its setting. A boy could go to the pond and lie on his back against the seat of a boat, lazily drifting from shore to shore while the loons dived and the swallows dipped around him.
								Thoreau loved to recall such sunny hours and summer days "when idleness was the most attractive and productive business."
								I too was a boy in love with a pond, rich in sunny hours and summer days. Sun and summer are still what they always were, but the boy and the pond changed. The boy, who is now a man, no longer finds much time for idle drifting. The pond has been annexed by a great city.
								The swamps where herons once hunted are now drained and filled with houses. The bay where water lilies quietly floated is now a harbor for motor boats. In short,everything that the boy loved no longer exists - except in the man's memory of it.
								Some people insist that only today and tomorrow matter. But how much poorer we would be if we really lived by that rule! So much of what we do today is frivolous and futile and soon forgotten. So much of what we hope to do tomorrow never happens.
								The past is the bank in which we store our most valuable possession: the memories that give meaning and depth to our lives.
								Those who truly treasure the past will not bemoan the passing of the good old days, because days enshrined in memory are never lost.
								Death itself is powerless to still a remembered voice or erase a remembered smile. And for one boy who is now a man, there is a pond which neither time nor tide can change, where he can still spend a quiet hour in the sun.</p>
								<!--<p>
								The setting sun is reflected from the windows of the alms-house as brightly as from the rich man's abode; the snow melts before its door as early in the spring. I do not see but a quiet mind may live as contentedly there, and have as cheering thoughts, as in a palace. The town's poor seem to me often to live
								the most independent lives of any. Maybe they are simply great enough to receive without misgiving. Most think that they are above being supported by the town; but it often happens that they are not above supporting themselves by dishonest means, which should be more disreputable. Cultivate poverty like a garden herb, like sage.
